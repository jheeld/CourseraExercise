For this project, I considered the headquarters building of the company that I work at. It is in San Francisco Bay Area and we own 4 floors of a 15 floor building. We are a tech company and hence everyone has their own laptops as well as separate monitors screens. Bay area is very spread out with not the most efficient transportation and also the city(SF) is very expensive to live in. Hence since nothing is in walking distance, people at work use a combination of driving in and public transport to get to work each day. 

For this exercise I calculated the GHG using Electricity used and Commuting Carbon Footprints. Though I have added a note about waste generated, I have not used it in my model. We also get a lot of food and snacks at work and I have not considered the carbon logistical footprint for each of them since it would make my model very complex.
