For this project, I considered the headquarters building of the company that I work at. It is in San Francisco Bay Area and we own 4 floors of a 15 floor building. We are a tech company and hence everyone has their own laptops as well as separate monitors screens. Bay area is very spread out with not the most efficient transportation and also the city(SF) is very expensive to live in. Hence since nothing is in walking distance, people at work use a combination of driving in and public transport to get to work each day. 

For this exercise I calculated the GHG using Electricity used and Commuting Carbon Footprints. Though I have added a note about waste generated, I have not used it in my model. We also get a lot of food and snacks at work and I have not considered the carbon logistical footprint for each of them since it would make my model very complex.

[Link to Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P9gyPU335r3j7zznuPlGkKokKAAMfv8KeWa85De0Xs/edit?usp=sharing)

Total Waste Generated for 400 Employees :
558 Tons Per Year

Assumptions For Electricity : 					
1. People use it for longer than 12 hours (Some people come in early and some people come in late)			
2. Number of Working Days in a year = 200					
3. Not Counting Standby Time of Any Electronics					
4. Assuming Incadescent Lights					
5. Not Adding any food related emissions

Assumptions for Commuting :
1. To Accounting For Public Transit the effects of shared usage we half the values. It should actually be lower.
2. Taken a random end point which is potentially average emissions
3. Not Accounted for Multi Modal Way of Transport to reduce model complexity
